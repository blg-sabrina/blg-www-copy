## Pembinaan: Pengebilan Kemajuan, Penjejakan Tahanan, Pengurusan Subkontraktor

Pelaksanaan ERP industri pembinaan memerlukan pengendalian khusus bagi projek jangka panjang, pengaturan pengebilan yang kompleks, dan penyelarasan subkontraktor yang meluas.

### Pengebilan Kemajuan dan Pengiktirafan Hasil

**Kaedah Pengiktirafan Hasil Kontrak**
```yaml
Percentage of Completion Method:
Cost-to-Cost Method:
  - Most common in construction
  - Based on costs incurred vs. total estimated costs
  - Requires accurate cost tracking
  - Regular estimate updates

Efforts-Expended Method:
  - Based on labor hours or units
  - Suitable for labor-intensive projects
  - Clear measurement criteria
  - Less dependent on cost estimates

Units of Delivery Method:
  - Based on physical progress
  - Suitable for repetitive units
  - Easy measurement and verification
  - Client acceptance required

Example Calculation:
Highway Construction Project:
Contract Value: MYR 50,000,000
Total Estimated Cost: MYR 40,000,000
Costs Incurred to Date: MYR 24,000,000

Percentage Complete = MYR 24,000,000 / MYR 40,000,000 = 60%
Revenue to Recognize = MYR 50,000,000 × 60% = MYR 30,000,000
Gross Profit = MYR 30,000,000 - MYR 24,000,000 = MYR 6,000,000
Gross Margin = 20%

Progress Billing Process:
